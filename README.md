The [Infinite Improbability Drive](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Improbability_Drive) is a wonderful new method of crossing interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. It was discovered by lucky chance, and then developed into a governable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government's research centre on Damogran.
